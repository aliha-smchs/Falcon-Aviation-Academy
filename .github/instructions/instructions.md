Migrate static data to a headless CMS (Strapi) and integrate it with the frontend to enable real-time content management and secure access for administrators.

Implementation Steps:
CMS Setup (Strapi)

Install and configure Strapi locally or on a cloud server.

Create the following content types with appropriate fields:

Aircraft (e.g., model, image, capacity, description)

Instructor (e.g., name, certifications, profile photo, availability)

Course (e.g., title, duration, outline, instructor reference)

Configure collection relationships (e.g., Courses reference Instructors).

Data Integration

Replace static frontend data with dynamic API calls to the Strapi backend.

Ensure components render data correctly, including fallback states (loading, error).

Optimize frontend queries with filtering, pagination, and population of nested content.

Authentication Setup

Implement JWT or OAuth authentication for admin panel access.

Protect routes like /admin, /dashboard, and CMS write operations.

Set role-based permissions in Strapi to distinguish between Editors and Admins.

Testing & Validation

Test API integration with real CMS data.

Validate authentication flows (login, logout, protected routes).

Check responsiveness and performance of data-driven components.
